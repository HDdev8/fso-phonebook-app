# fso-phonebook-app

Phonebook app created with Express and React

**Link to project:** <https://fso-phonebook-app.onrender.com>

## How It's Made

**Tech used:** React, Express, Vite, Axios, JavaScript, CSS

I built the backend of this app with Express.js and the frontend with React.js. I used Axios on the frontend as well. I deployed this app using Render.com.

## Optimizations

This is a simple app that allows for creating, reading, updating, and deleting phonebook entries.

## Lessons Learned

This is one of my first projects built with React, and my first built with Express. I'm already liking React, and I'm excited for further explore how it differs from JavaScript. I appreciated learning the backend, working with http requests, and learning more about promises as well as all the packages available to developers (such as Axios).
